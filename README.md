This program takes in a video, counts the number of people per zone (which can be customised, assuming each zone has an equal area) and highlights each zone depending on how crowded they are relative to each other. Zones that are too crowded are coloured red, those that are too empty are coloured blue, zones that have the optimal number of people (ie closest to the average number of people per zone) are coloured green.
